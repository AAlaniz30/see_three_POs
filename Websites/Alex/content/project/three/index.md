summary: When breaking into a new market it's hard to judge business risks - especially when data is scarce. I built an agent-based simulation of market behavior and calibrated it on a tiny test/train dataset with Approximate Bayesian Computation. Used by Newton Launch Systems to win a share of a Â£500k UK government grant. Predicted the weak market growth that drove out a major competitor in 2022.
