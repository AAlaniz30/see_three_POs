  Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That's me! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school...

  Those were awkward.Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry! Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? You going to the funeral? No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.

  Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
