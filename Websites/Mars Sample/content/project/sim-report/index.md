## How we use forecasts to help

Dense cloud cover blocks UV rays, but also starves fast-growing crop plants of light for photosynthesis. **Both factors can affect agrochemical products.**

## Building 'what if?' scenarios

## How the simulation works

made up by simulating each crop vid


combine to get economic outcomes for the plot as a whole vid


#### 

To explore how cloud cover impacted product outcomes in Florida, **we needed to estimate cloud cover on farms for the entire week prior to product application.**

#### Inputs were varied

Look at this

## How we improved the end-user experience
