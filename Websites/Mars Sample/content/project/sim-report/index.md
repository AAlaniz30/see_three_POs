## Motivation

Diverse agroforestry systems can offer many environmental and economic benefits. The Farm System Diversification Program has been working with Ecodata Technologies to quantify these benefits.

## Data collection takes time

Farms can take a while to reach good returns, especially those growing long-lived perennial trees. Cocoa trees fruit for 30 years, but we don't have to wait 30 years to compare cocoa ROI to shorter-lived annual crops.

## Using forecasts to help

Our partners at Ecodata Technology have developed simulations to forecast the range of economic outcomes we can expect under different agroforestry designs.

## Building 'what if?' scenarios

These simulations allow us to screen new hypothetical farm plot designs for potential performance before committing valuable resources.

# How the simulation works

<!-- The webm version loses the pause at the end, so I've retained gifs for the two timelapse animations. Just uncomment to revert to the webms. -->

Under the hood, each crop is simulated independently. These are aggregated to make forecasts for the whole plot.

## Input data were curated

First, data for each crop were collected from our farms in Sulawesi. Ecodata developed a data cleaning pipeline to standardize these parameters and validate against external data sources.

## Economic inputs were varied

Labor and materials costs were unique for each crop, extending across multiple different time-scales - some crops live for over 30 years, others for under 12 months.

The team at Ecodata were selected for their experience with modeling this diversity we see in our agroecological systems. For example, our timber species are destructively harvested, which had to be simulated differently to non-destructive harvesting of fruits.

Monthly time-steps capture seasonal variation in crop performance and enable us to compare long-lived and short-lived crops.

## Simple business metrics

Predicted harvests are summarized in dollar terms, accounting for factors such as inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.

# Powering new business questions

Ecodata have provided extensive tooling for us to ask how different agricultural plot designs might perform.

## Getting granular

Simulation results are gathered into a Tableau dashboard where we can slice through the results. For example, we can search for pain points in each crop's life-cycle by assess how yields, expenses, and revenues evolve month-on-month.

## Custom plot designs

We can easily provide the specifications for new plot designs to feed into the model. To date we've investigated over 150 different farm designs, integrating up to 30 different crops.

## The bottom line

With these tools we've been able to explore the potential opportunities and risks when adopting new crop varieties, rotations, and intercropping strategies before ever planting a new seed in the ground.
