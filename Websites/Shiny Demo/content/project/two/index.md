  Pest-forecasting tools 'in the cloud' need deep technical expertise. The payoff is easy access for stakeholders to state-of-the-art, demanding models built on up-to-date data. We take inspiration from the tech industry's approach to MLOps.
  
  Our data and scripts are stored on an Amazon Web Service EC2 instance, which scales on-the-fly to meet computing needs. The Ubuntu virtual machine also hosts the Shiny server used to share the results on the web, and Nginx and Certbot for accessibility and security.
  
  From there we can embed our apps in convenient web reports like this one, built with Hugo, maintained on GitHub, and deployed on Netlify.
