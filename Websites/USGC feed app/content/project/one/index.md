summary: |-
  Spongy moth is a destructive invader in North America, arriving in the late 1800s. The caterpillars defoliate trees, stripping them clean of the ability to photosynthesize and devastating acres of forest and residential green-space.
  
  Ecodata scraped climate data and merged it with iNaturalist field surveys, then modeled pest densities in time and space using cumulative degree days. 
  
  With these fitted general additive models, we can then forecast where and when both caterpillars and adults will appear by feeding in future climate data. And with a web-app we can disseminate the results to users in an approachable way.
