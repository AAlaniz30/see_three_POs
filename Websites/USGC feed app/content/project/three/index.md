  Spotted lanternfly is a recent threat, arriving in North America in 2014. These pests feed on a wide range of crops including grapes, apples, hops, walnuts, and hardwood trees. Early detection of is a vital step in containing its spread.
  
  Ecodata is exploring how Bayesian GAMs can provide more better forecasts of pests, both in Spotted lanternfly and Spongy moth. We've found that Bayesian GAMs can predict both caterpillar and adult emergence in Spongy moth, supporting more sophisticated control strategies based on life stage.
  
  Though data quality and quantity are still low for lanternfly, a similar approach will be valuable for managing this new invasive species. As we progress from research and development, the models will be put into production as another web app.
